        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a creative, funny, and yet shy person. I like to 3D print and I have made it into a small buisness. I also like to play video games, spacificly VR games. I have a cockapoochi dog named Bailey, he is very cute. I used to have two cats name Maly and Moxie but they sadly passed away.</p>
        <p>I absolutely love taking pictures. I have a Nikon D780, a 24 to 120 mm lens and a 70 to 300 mm lens. I have the ability to invent extentions for my camera for instance, I invented a holder for my 950,000 lumen flashlight. I also invented a filter holder for my camera which could hold up to 9 sheets of filter paper</p>
